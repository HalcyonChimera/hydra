**Caveat emptor:** These "recipes" are community contributions, not officially supported Hydra "solutions". YMMV.

***

[[Use HTTP POST for Solr requests]] - This may be necessary if Hydra's Solr requests, due to access control conditions, become too long for the default HTTP GET method.

[[Indexing non English content]] - if you are indexing non English content into Hydra, you may want to update your Solr config to take advantage of Solr's language specific stemming capabilities.

[[Using rdf:resource within your models]]
